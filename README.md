This repository is discontinued given the fact that TensorFlow have a much better and complete interface to this experiments and my code needs much more work to be complete. 

Please reffer to their tutorial on [seq2seq models] (http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html)


These were my experiments implementing "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" paper by
Sutskever et al. (2014).
